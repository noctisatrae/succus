# succus - decentralized chat package.
succus is a tool allowing you to easily create **your own decentralized chat** for the ETH ecosystem and integrate it into your web app.

## [Check out the docs!](https://github.com/noctisatrae/succus/blob/master/docs/docs.md)

## Improvement ideas
- Make a config.js containing important ressources and configuration like the SEA key so you don't have to pass them as an argument everytime!
